        <h3>Professional life</h3>
        <p>
            Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Sarth Ganesh Aradhye and I am a engineering student. I have been part of
            many associations and units.
            And had leaded around 50 members with 15 heads and 35 members at most. Also have I have leaded many group
            mini projects. I have specialization in programing languages like Julia, Python, Java, JavaScript, Elixer,
            Prolog & Solidity languages. I have interest in recent technologies and with my degree(B.E.(I.T.)) I am also
            pursuing speciallization in Blockchain technologies. I belive in innovation and revolutionary ideas which
            can bring chain in the future.
            but while bringing change I take care that technology should not be harmful and hurt my conservationalist
            ideology. Currently I have founded
            a startup called as Aradhye Tech which emphasis on my ideology and try to bring change to the society.

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>

            Hey ya! How are you all? I hope you would be fine, in this section I would be revelling to you my Personal
            side and hope you would like itüòä.
            My Ideology revolves around one mantra from rigved
            <br>
            <b class="mantra" style="text-align: center;">‡§Ü ‡§®‡•ã ‡§≠‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§É ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§µ‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§¶‡§¨‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§™‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§â‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§ø‡§¶‡§É ||</b>
            <br>
            Which translates to <b>Let noble thoughts come from all directions</b><br>
            Hence I will tolerate your thoughts and even we can have debate on our thoughts(note: Debates on TV and no
            allowed specially like Arnab Goswamiü§£)
            And see, to impress me is very easy (Kya Kare bhole ke bhakt hai) just be polite, kind and loyal to me. I
            love
            to travel which makes me happy when you don't see me in college deffinately you will see me exploring the
            city and enjoying the positive vibes of people.
            Have a nice day!!!
        </p>
